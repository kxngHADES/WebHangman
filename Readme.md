# 2-Player Hangman

**Note:** This project is a work in progress and is not yet complete. Once finalized, users will be able to host it on their own servers.

A simple 2-player Hangman game using Node.js and Socket.IO. Players can create and join rooms to play Hangman with each other in real-time.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   If you haven't already cloned the repository, do so with:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Node.js packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### File Structure

- `public/index.html`: The HTML front-end for the game.
- `server.js`: The Node.js server that handles game logic and Socket.IO communication.

### Running the Server

1. **Start the Node.js Server**

   Run the server with:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Open the Game in a Browser**

   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. You should see the game interface.

### Using the Game

1. **Create a Room**

   Click the "Create Room" button to create a new game room. You will receive a room ID that you can share with the second player.

2. **Join a Room**

   Enter the room ID in the "Enter Room ID" field and click "Join Room" to join an existing game.

3. **Set a Word**

   The player who created the room will be prompted to enter a word for the other player to guess. This player is the "word setter."

4. **Make Guesses**

   Both players can make guesses by entering a letter and clicking the "Guess" button.

5. **Game Over**

   The game will notify players when the game is over and display the result.

### Troubleshooting

- **Server Not Starting:** Ensure all dependencies are installed and there are no syntax errors in your `server.js` file.
- **Socket.IO Issues:** Check the console in your browser’s developer tools for connection errors and ensure your server is running.
- **Page Not Loading:** Make sure you are accessing the correct URL (`http://localhost:3000`).
